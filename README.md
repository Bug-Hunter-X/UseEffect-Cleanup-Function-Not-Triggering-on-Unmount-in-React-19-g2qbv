# React 19 useEffect Cleanup Issue

This repository demonstrates a problem with the cleanup function in React's `useEffect` hook within React 19.  The cleanup function, designed to run when the component unmounts, is unexpectedly not being triggered.

## Problem Description

The `bug.js` file contains a React component that uses `useEffect` with a cleanup function.  Despite the component unmounting, the 'Unmounted!' log message from the cleanup function does not appear in the console.  This indicates a potential issue with how React 19 handles the cleanup phase of the effect lifecycle.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version.  While a simple fix is unlikely to exist (since the problem itself is rather uncommon), it is possible that the issue is tied to something external to the component (in other words, something in the parent component that might be causing this). The solutions could also include checking the rendering behavior in development versus production, making sure that the component is actually being unmounted correctly, and that there are no errors in the parent component that could be preventing the unmount. More extensive testing and debugging will be needed to isolate the problem effectively.
